## Overview

This is a modpack set in a post-apocalyptic world, where players use superpowers and light technology to survive and uncover the truth behind the catastrophic Psionic Storm.

## Story Background
In the near future, scientists, through their research on superpowers, established a modern system of magic. On the other side, after the failure of the Level 6 Esper Project, Kihara Gensei, driven by despair and madness, turned his focus to parasites, attempting to create the "Transcendent" — a being that cannot be defined by societal classes, an existence that transcends all. However, the experiment went out of control, triggering a massive Psionic Storm that swept across the Earth and disrupted the already unstable dimensional walls. Countless lives were lost, thriving cities were abandoned, and unknown creatures were pulled to Earth from the disturbances in the dimensional barriers. Players must develop their own superpowers and apply knowledge such as CAD (Casting Assistant Device) to survive in this altered land and journey to other dimensions to uncover the truth behind the tragedy.
